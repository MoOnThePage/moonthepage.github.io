**MoOnThePage**: My Personal Website and learning journey.

This project is a reflection, on my growing skills and experience while taking the [**Full Stack Developer Curriculum**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) at freeCodeCamp (🔥)

The goal of this website is to showcase what I can do, my projects, my ideas, and my progress as I continue learning web development.
